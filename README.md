# Paper Cup Lamp

## Overview

This project is inspired by the [Cup Lamp](https://makecode.adafruit.com/projects/cartoon-network/cup-lamp), but adapted for the [Circuit Playground Classic](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3000) using the Adafruit library to [read capacitance](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuit-playground-lesson-number-0/alligator-pads-pinout) off of the pins.
